<h1> Explainable AI in Brain Tumour detection </h1>
In this project I have trained 3 different Convolutional neural networks to detect 4 types of brain tumour: 'notumor', 'pituitary', 'meningioma', and 'glioma' and applied Grad-Cam, Grad-Cam++ and Lime to all 3 of them.

<h2> Dataset used</h2>
The dataset I have used consist of 7,023 images with 5,712 images used for training and 1,311 used for testing the models.
